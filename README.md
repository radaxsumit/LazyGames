# 🎮 LazyGames

Welcome to the LazyGames repository!

- This is my personal playground for developing games with a laid-back, "get it done" attitude. This repository showcases my journey into game development and version control, focusing on simplicity and, well, laziness.

## 🎮🕹️ Whack-a-Cock:The Game
This is a fun and simple take on the classic arcade game, "Whack-a-Mole." The goal is to whack as many cocks as you can before time runs out! It’s a work in progress, so feel free to watch me make some questionable decisions along the way.
